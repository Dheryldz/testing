# testing

Simple testing library for node.js.

## Installation

Just run:
    $ npm install testing

Or add package testing to your package.json dependencies.

## Usage

Add asynchronous testing to your code very easily. Require testing:

    var testing = require('testing');

Add a test function to your code:

    function testThis(callback)
    {
        if (1 + 1 == 2)
        {
            testing.success(callback);
        }
        else
        {
            testing.failure('Maths fail', callback);
        }
    }

Run all tests:

    testing.run({
        this: testThis,
    });

Will run tests sequentially.

## API

Integration is very easy.

### Basics

Callbacks are used for asynchronous testing. They follow the usual node.js convention:

    callback(error, result);

When no callback is passed, synchronous testing is performed.

#### testing.success([callback])

Note success for the current test.

#### testing.failure([message], [callback])

Note failure for the current test.

If the callback is present, calls the callback with the error:

    callback(message);

Otherwise the message is shown using console.error().

Default message: 'Error'.

#### testing.run(tests, [timeout], [callback])

Run a set of tests. The first parameter is an object containing one attribute for every testing function. Example:

    testing.run({
        first: testFirst,
        second: testSecond,
    });

For each attribute, the key is used to display success; the value is a testing function that accepts an optional callback.

The tests are considered as a failure when a certain configurable timeout has passed.
The timeout parameter is in milliseconds. The default is 1 second per test.

When the optional callback is given, it is called after a failure or the success of all tests.

Note: testing uses async to run tests in series.

### Asserts

There are several utility methods for assertions.

#### testing.assert(condition, [message], [callback])

Checks condition; if true, does nothing. Otherwise calls the callback passing the message, if present.

When there is no callback, just prints the message to console.log() for success, console.error() for errors.

Default message: 'Assertion error'.

#### testing.assertEquals(expected, actual, [message], [callback])

Check that the given values are equal. Uses weak equality (==).

Message and callback behave just like above.

### Showing results

You can use your own function to show results. The library provides a premade callback:

#### testing.show(error, result)

Show an error if present, a success if there was no error.
